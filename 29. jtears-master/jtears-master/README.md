## Warning
I would not run this on anything you care about. There is no decryption methodology yet... Run in a VM.

## How it works

- The application first tries to figure out the highest most point in the file tree that it has write access to.
- Once the start point is determined, it forks runners to encrypt each subdirectory in the start point.
- No decryption yet...
